# rcht/aoc24

My attempts at Advent of Code 2024. If the problem is easy, I try a self-imposed challenge like doing it in Haskell or using as few lines as possible. 

| Day | Star | Self-imposed challenge |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Gold | Haskell | 
| 2 | Gold | Haskell |
| 3 | Gold | Python one-liner for part 1, Haskell for part 2 |
